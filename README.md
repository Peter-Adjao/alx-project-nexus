# alx-project-nexus
# Detailed Progress &amp; Technical Mastery from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program
# 📱 Mobile Development with React Native
Developed robust mobile apps using React Native and Expo.

# Key Achievements
✅ Multi-screen navigation with Expo Router

✅ Integrated real-time API data across screens

✅ Prepared builds for real-world deployment

Example: Navigation Setup with Expo Router
tsx
// app/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function Layout() {
  return <Stack />;
}
tsx
// app/index.tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
export default function Home() {
  return <Link href="/details">Go to Details</Link>;
}
```

# ⚛️ ReactGuard: Error Handling & Resilience
Strengthened app reliability through better error management.

Tools Used
ErrorBoundary

Conditional rendering & fallback UI

Custom error hooks

Example: React Error Boundary
tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };
  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

# 🌐 Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
Learned to deliver lightning-fast web experiences.

Techniques Applied
Service Worker setup

Offline caching

PWA manifest configuration

Example: Basic Service Worker Registration
tsx
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(() => console.log('Service Worker Registered'));
}

# 🔁 Advanced State Management
Built scalable apps with structured state logic.

Core Concepts
Redux Toolkit and Thunk

Context API with custom hooks

Memoization and performance tuning

Example: Redux Slice Setup
ts
// features/products/productSlice.ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const productSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'products',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    setProducts: (state, action) => action.payload,
  },
});

export const { setProducts } = productSlice.actions;
export default productSlice.reducer;
```

# 💻 TypeScript & Next.js Architecture
Mastered scalable frontend architecture and advanced typing.

Highlights
Advanced TypeScript: generics, guards, decorators

Alias paths and strict types

Modular React components

Example: Path Alias Configuration
json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["src/utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

# 🎨 Styling & UI/UX
Delivered polished user interfaces across devices.

* Tools & Practices
Tailwind CSS & NativeWind

* Figma prototyping

* Responsive & accessible design

Example: Tailwind Component
tsx
export default function Button() {
  return <button className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Click Me</button>;
}

# 🛠 Git & GitHub Workflow Challenges
Documented real-world Git problems and practical solutions.

# 🧩 Challenge	⚙️ Fix
* Pushed to wrong branch	Used git branch -m, switched with git checkout
src refspec error	Verified current branch and pushed with correct name

* Remote repo missing	Fixed with git remote add origin <url>
File accidentally deleted	Restored via git restore filename

* Merge conflicts	Resolved manually then git add + git commit
Forgetting to stage	Habit shift: use git add . and git status often

# 🔑 Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
* 🧼 Clean, modular code structure

* ⚡️ Performance-aware data handling

* ♿ Accessibility-first layout choices

* 🧪 Documented design and deployment decisions

* 📘 Improved debugging and commit hygiene
```

# 🧠 Final Reflection
Each win—from fixing Git hiccups to building deployable apps—has pushed me closer to becoming a resilient, real-world front-end engineer. I now write code with intention, manage state like a pro, and architect projects with scalability in mind.
